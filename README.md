# Backpacking food recipes

## Notes on ingredients

* Spices are probably from [Penzey's](https://www.penzeys.com/).
* Dried beans, veg, etc., probably from [Harmony House](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/) or [re grocery](https://regrocery.co/)

## Portions

* Portions are "one meal for one person"
* One breakfast + lunch + dinner will approach 2,000 calories/day.
  This amount is too few for most people.
  Adjust accordingly with snacks.

## Storage

* All meals pack very small.
* I use [HoldOn](https://holdonbags.com/) sandwich bags.
  These are affordable, easy to clean, durable enough for multiple trips, and compostable.

## Cooked

### Skurka rice and beans

See [here](https://andrewskurka.com/backpacking-dinner-recipe-beans-rice-with-fritos-cheese/).

* I use dehydrated pinto beans as the base.
* Couscous can be a good substitute for rice.
  Many "instant"/quick rices aren't very healthy.

## Cold soaked

* I use a Talenti gelato container for soaking.

### Skurka oatmeal

See [here](https://andrewskurka.com/breakfast-recipe-coconut-chia-oatmeal/).
I do this as overnight oats.

Notes:

* Easy to do hot. (Only option if overnight temps will get near freezing.)
* Overnight oats may mean that your soaking jar has to fit in your bear canister.

### Curry couscous

(This is based on a recipe that used to be up on Skurka's site.)

Ingredients:

* 2.5oz couscous. (Not Israeli! The small granule kind.)
* 1oz textured vegetable protein. (Bob's Red Mill is a solid choice)
* 1oz dehydrated peas
* salt to taste -- 0.25 to 0.5 tsp for longer trips
* 0.5-0.75tsp sweet curry powder
* 0.25-0.5tsp garam marsala
* 1 - 2 tbsp of olive oil

Ignoring the spices, that's 4.5oz of dried goods that give about 440 calories.
2tbsp of olive oil is about an ounce.
We end up with 5.5oz and over 650 calories.

This recipe has a lot of room for variation.
You can reduce the bulk by swapping the peas for dehydrated mashed potatoes or corn.
Replace TVP with a source of carbs if you want more carbs vs protein.
Taco seasoning instead of curry.
Etc..

To prep as a hot meal:

* Heat ~300ml water
* Add dry ingredients
* Add olive oil
* Stir, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes.

This meal should also cold soak well with the same amount of water.
