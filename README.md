# Backpacking food recipes

## Notes on ingredients

* Spices are probably from [Penzey's](https://www.penzeys.com/).
* Dried beans, veg, etc., probably from [Harmony House](https://www.harmonyhousefoods.com/)

## Portions

* Portions are "one meal for one person"
* One breakfast + lunch + dinner will approach 2,000 calories/day.
  This amount is too few for most people.
  Adjust accordingly with snacks.

## Storage

* All meals pack very small.
* I use [HoldOn](https://holdonbags.com/) sandwich bags.
  These are affordable, easy to clean, durable enough for multiple trips, and compostable.

## Cooked

### Skurka rice and beans

See [here](https://andrewskurka.com/backpacking-dinner-recipe-beans-rice-with-fritos-cheese/).

* I use dehydrated pinto beans as the base.
* Couscous can be a good substitute for rice.
  Many "instant"/quick rices aren't very healthy.

## Cold soaked

* I use a Talenti gelato container for soaking.

### Skurka oatmeal

See [here](https://andrewskurka.com/breakfast-recipe-coconut-chia-oatmeal/).
I do this as overnight oats.

Notes:

* Easy to do hot. (Only option if overnight temps will get near freezing.)
* Overnight oats may mean that your soaking jar has to fit in your bear canister.

### Coconut curry couscous

Ingredients:

* 2.5oz couscous. (Not Israeli! The small granule kind.)
* 0.5oz shredded coconut
* 1.25oz chia seeds (~3 tbsp)
* 0.75oz sunflower seeds
* 1oz dried raisins
* salt to taste -- 0.25 to 0.5 tsp for longer trips
* 1tsp sweet curry powder
* 0.5tsp garam marsala
* "dash" of cinnamon

Approximately 640 calories.

To soak:

* Add ingredients to Talenti jar
* Fill with water to bottom of threads.
* Close and shake.
* Done in ~15 minutes.
